## About The Project

**Blain** is a powerful open-source Bluetooth security framework designed for penetration testers, researchers, and advanced users. Built by Anas Erami, Blain aims to provide a professional-grade toolkit for discovering, assessing, and exploiting Bluetooth vulnerabilities â€” with an emphasis on ethical usage and zero-day research.

Version 2.0 introduces a full-featured **fuzzing engine**, making Blain a next-gen platform for discovering previously unknown vulnerabilities in BLE devices.

## Key Features

### Reconnaissance & Scanning
- **Dual-Mode Scanning:** Supports both Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) and BLE.
- **Deep Profiling:** Gathers detailed info: name, MAC, vendor, RSSI, services.
- **Service Enumeration:** Extracts SDP and GATT services for attack surface mapping.

### Vulnerability Assessment
- **Modular JSON Database:** Load, update, and manage known vulnerability definitions.
- **Active Rule-Based Testing:** Goes beyond version checks â€” executes commands and pairing attempts to confirm vulnerabilities like BlueBorne, KNOB, and BIAS.

### Exploitation Toolkit
- **Pairing Exploits:** Common-PIN, forced pairing, and bypass attacks.
- **BLE Data Access:** Read/write/subscribe to BLE characteristics.
- **AVRCP/OBEX Hijack:** Take control of media or access files from vulnerable targets.
- **DoS Attacks:** Launch GATT or L2CAP flood attacks.
- **A2DP Eavesdropping:** (Experimental, requires Ubertooth or SDR hardware).

### Zero-Day Fuzzing Engine
- **Mutation-Based Fuzzing:** Smart (bit-flip) and dumb fuzzing modes.
- **Live Target Health Check:** Auto-monitoring via l2ping.
- **Crash Logging:** Generates detailed JSON crash reports with test data.

### Monitoring & Post-Exploitation
- **Bluetooth Sniffing:** Integrated with Wireshark/dumpcap.
- **Logs & Reports:** Structured output for all scans, exploits, and fuzzing attempts.

## âš™ Requirements

### System Requirements
- **OS:** Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Kali, Parrot, etc.)
- **Permissions:** Root (sudo) access required
- **Hardware:** Compatible Bluetooth adapter (Classic & BLE)

### Dependencies

Blain requires several tools and libraries. Run the installer to handle them.

#### System Packages
- `bluez`, `bluez-tools`, `ubertooth`, `ffmpeg`, `gr-bluetooth`, `wireshark`

#### Python Modules
- `bleak`, `pexpect`, `pyobex`, `dbus-python`, `colorama`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anas-2003/Blain-ma.git
cd Blain-ma
```

### 2. Run the Installer
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh

sudo ./setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Install all system dependencies
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all Python modules
- Launch the framework

To specify an adapter:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

sudo ./setup.sh --adapter hci1
```
